I use the [numeral cheatsheet](http://craftyblues.com/article/2012/10/07/numeralCheatSheet/) that I posted a while back all the time. Mostly, I use it to find the blues scale in various keys. To make this task simpler, I wrote [this little web app](http://bluescalc.ryanparsley.com/). It's pretty basic at this point, you pick a root note and it displays the rest of the notes in the coresponding blues scale. I'll add more features (display the progression?) as time allows.
