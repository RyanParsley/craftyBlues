A little while back I [wrote about the conventions of
CBGs](http://craftyblues.com/blog/2012/09/19/3string135tuning/) to be
tuned in I V I tuning and that a I III V or I IIIb V tuning made more
sense to me. I wasnâ€™t sure what order to put them or whether or not to
use the flatted third. 

Thinking about this more, I got curious about the
relationship between strings on a standard tuned guitar. The bottom
strings are G B E. Assuming E as your root that maps to IIIb V I. This
blew my mind. That means that a standard tuned 3 string guitar is also openly tuned. For quick reference, that maps to Bb D G.
