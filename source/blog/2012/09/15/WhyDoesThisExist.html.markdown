I am fairly new to making music. It wasn't a part of my childhood. Music
seemed like a magical thing that a select few could create and others,
like myself, could only consume. Over the past four years, I've been playing 
my wife's Strat and slowly teaching myself a little about music theory. 
I'm far from being an expert on the subject, but I have managed to dispell
much of the mystique around music.

On more than one occasion I thought "I'd like to make a guitar". It seemed 
like a big task, but a rewarding one. At the same time, my dad happened
to start making "cigar box guitars" and introduced me to them. I'd heard 
of cigar box guitars (CBGs), but not seen many examples in the wild. After 
a little Googling, I realized what a fun canvas this instrument can be.

Once the bug bit me, I could not find enough information about playing CBGs 
to satisfy me. I found two [great](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565235479/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=ryan0d-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=1565235479&adid=0FPVX9NCG50J5P47Q57F&)

on the subject and there is a great 
[community](http://www.cigarboxnation.com/) [online](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cigar+box+guitar&page=&utm_source=opensearch), but it wasn't enough. I started making
my own tableture, fretboard maps and other resources for myself. 

There is a bit of a "we don't need theory" belief out there in the CBG 
community. I find this frustrating, it reminds me of the magical shroud 
that kept me away from making music for so long. I do, in fact, need and 
want theory. While compiling and creating resourses for myself I decided 
to share them in the hopes that my work will help others who want a deeper 
understanding of CBGs.
