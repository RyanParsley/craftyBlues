I am fairly new to making music. It wasn't a part of my childhood. Music
seemed like a magical thing that a select few could create and others,
like myself, could only consume. Over the past four years, I've been playing 
my wife's Strat and slowly teaching myself a little about music theory. 
I haven't logged enough practice hours to be very good, but I have
dispelled the mystique around music.

On more than one occasion I thought "I'd like to make a guitar". It seemed 
like a big task, but a rewarding one. Last Fall, my dad mentioned that he 
had made a few "cigar box guitars". I'd heard of cigar box guitars
(CBGs), but not seen many examples in the wild. After a little Googling, 
I realized what a fun canvas this instrument can be.

Once the bug bit me, I could not find enough information about playing CBGs 
to satisfy me. I found two great books on the subject and there is a great 
community online [list url], but it wasn't enough. I started making
my own tableture, fretboard maps and other resources for myself. 

There is a bit of a "we don't need theory" belief out there in the CBG 
community. I find this frustrating, it reminds me of the magical shroud 
that kept me away from making music for so long. I do, in fact, need and 
want theory. While compiling and creating resourses for myself I decided 
to share them in the hopes that my work will help others who want a deeper 
understanding of CBGs.
