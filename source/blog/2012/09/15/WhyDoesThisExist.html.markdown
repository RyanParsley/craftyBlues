I have recently become smitten with cigar box guitars (GBGs). I had been
playing my wife's Strat for a few years and thought "I'd like to make a
guitar". Oddly enough, soon after, my dad mentions that he has made a
few cigar box guitars. I've been playing around with one of the first
GBGs he made for a while now and I feel a certain liberation from the
simplicity that comes with just 3 strings.
